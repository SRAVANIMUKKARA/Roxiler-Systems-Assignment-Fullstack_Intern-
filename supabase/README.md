1. Project Structure & Tech Stack
Backend: Express.js + PostgreSQL via pg or using ORM (Knex.js / TypeORM).

Frontend: React, using Create React App or Vite.

Authentication: JWT with role-based middleware.

API setup: Separate client/ and server/ folders, proxy React to Express during development

üîê 2. Database Schema (Postgres)
Three core tables: users, stores, ratings.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- users
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL
email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL
password_hash TEXT NOT NULL
address VARCHAR(400)
role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL  -- 'admin', 'user', 'owner'

-- stores
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL
email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL
address VARCHAR(400)

-- ratings
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
store_id INTEGER REFERENCES stores(id)
user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
UNIQUE(store_id, user_id)  -- one rating per user per store
Indexes on names and emails for filtering and sorting.

üîí 3. Auth & Roles
JWT authentication with signup/login endpoints.

Middleware to guard routes based on user role.

Roles:

Admin: full CRUD, view stats.

User: browse stores, submit/edit ratings.

Store Owner: view ratings for their store only.

üìà 4. REST APIs Breakdown
Role	Endpoint	Description
Public	POST /api/auth/signup	Normal user signup
Public	POST /api/auth/login	Login for all roles, returns a JWT
Admin	POST /api/users	Add new user/store
Admin	GET /api/stats	Dashboard stats (total users, stores, ratings)
Admin	GET /api/users	List users (filter/sort available)
Admin	GET /api/stores	List stores (filter/sort available)
User	GET /api/stores	List stores with overall rating
User	POST /api/stores/:id/rate	Submit or update rating
Owner	GET /api/owners/me/stores	List their stores with avg rating and raters
Owner	GET /api/owners/stores/:id/ratings	List user ratings for their store

üß† 5. Frontend (React)
Use Context or Redux for auth state (JWT + role).

Forms (signup, login, rating, password change) with validation:

Name: 20‚Äì60 chars

Address: ‚â§‚ÄØ400 chars

Password: 8‚Äì16, at least one uppercase + special char

Email: standard pattern

UI:

Admin: Dashboard statistics, user/store management with sorting/filtering.

User: Store roundup, search by name/address, rating component (1‚Äì5 stars) with modify feature.

Store Owner: Dashboard listing raters + average rating.

Style with your specified color scheme and clean transitions.

‚úÖ 6. Bonus & Best Practices
Implement PostgreSQL transactions for rating updates.

Use Express pagination and safe filters.

Normalize API responses and handle errors with proper HTTP codes.

Add unit tests (Jest for backend; React Testing Library for frontend).

Document endpoints in README.md, including setup, migrations, and run instructions.
